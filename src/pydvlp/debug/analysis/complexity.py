"""Advanced complexity analysis for Python functions and modules.

This module provides comprehensive code complexity analysis including:
- Cyclomatic complexity (traditional control flow complexity)
- Cognitive complexity (human-perceived complexity)
- Halstead metrics (algorithmic complexity)
- Maintainability index calculation
- Nesting depth analysis
- Custom complexity scoring and grading

The complexity analyzer helps identify code that may be difficult to
maintain, test, or understand, providing actionable recommendations
for improvement.
